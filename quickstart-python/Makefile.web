# Makefile.web for raylib-quickstart-python
#
# NOTE: Compiling Python to WebAssembly via emcc directly is not supported
# in the same way as C/C++ or Zig. Python is an interpreted language.
#
# To run this project on the web, you typically need:
# 1. A Python runtime compiled to WASM (like Pyodide).
# 2. Compatible Raylib bindings for the web runtime.
#
# As of now, this usually involves using Pyodide and loading your script.
# A simple "emcc compile" cannot convert main.py to a standalone .html file
# without a bundled interpreter.
#
# Recommended Approach:
# Visit https://pyodide.org/ and check for Raylib support or use a
# community template for Raylib-Python on Web.
